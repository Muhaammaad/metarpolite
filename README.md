# Metarpolite

A METAR browser for Android, so that anyone can quickly search and browse the NOAA database.

**Things which need to be considered:** 

1. [ ] 100% java language
2. [ ] MVVM architecture
3. [ ] Only the Google APIs and official libraries are allowed
4. [ ] The app should also be useable offline, meaning that whenever it is online, the latest reports should be downloaded locally
5. [ ] The application should only concentrate on the Key specific airports
6. [ ] METARs are updated regularly during the day, SO need to be updated
